# RTFKT Contract Factory

### Update week of Jun 28

- [x] Wrote and tested functional v1 of backend service
  - [x] Wrote contract deployment (to Rinkeby testnet) logic
  - [x] Learnt and incorporated Infura into project
  - [x] Wrote basic features (i.e. balanceOf & getTransactionCount)
  - [x] Did NOT get to building a _mint API call b/c it is internal in the 0xcert/ERC721 standard I am using
- [x] Researched about ether.js 
  - [x] Stuck with web3 b/c it is most popular, has more contributors and history

Next Week

- [ ] Look into OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts in details (seems like something we could use...?)
- [ ] Implement the contract & token names setting feature
  - [ ] Token name setting stalled by the internal _mint API call
